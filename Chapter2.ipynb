    "Recall that the frequentist interpretation of conditional probability based on a large number `n` of repetitions of an experiment is $P(A|B) â‰ˆ n_{AB}/n_{B}$, where $n_{AB}$ is the number of times that $A \\cap B$ occurs and $n_{B}$ is the number of times that $B$ occurs. Let's try this out by simulation, and verify the results of Example 2.2.5. So let's use [`numpy.random.choice`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) to simulate `n` families, each with two children."
